# Machine Learning Study Resources

This repository contains documentation and Jupyter notebooks that I use for studying machine learning. The materials cover various topics and practical implementations, providing a comprehensive learning experience.

## Project Setup

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .mld-venv

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   
   ```bash
    source .mld-venv/bin/activate

3. **Install Required Packages:**
    Make sure you have `pip` installed, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Installing PyTorch:**
    For installing the latest pre-release version of PyTorch along with torchvision and torchaudio, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
